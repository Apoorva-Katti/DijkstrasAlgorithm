This is the implementation of Dijkstra`s algorithm for the graph defined in data.txt

Here, the first two numbers represent the number of vertices and edges. The letter D stands for
Directed Acyclic graph. This letter might be U meaning undirected graph. From the second line on we have edges and its weight (e.g. edge(A,B) and its weight is 10. The last line is optional. If given, it represents the source node.

Input
-----
Run the graph.py and input the starting node. The code will find the shortest path and print
the cost table and paths involved.
